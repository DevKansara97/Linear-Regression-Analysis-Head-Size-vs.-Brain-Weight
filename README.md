# Linear-Regression-Analysis-Head-Size-vs.-Brain-Weight

**Repository Description:
**
This project implements a simple linear regression model to analyze the relationship between head size (in cm³) and brain weight (in grams). Using both manual calculations and scikit-learn's Linear Regression, it demonstrates key concepts such as:

- Calculating slope, intercept, and R² score manually.
- Plotting scatter plots and regression lines for visualization.
- Evaluating model confidence levels.
- Comparing results with scikit-learn's built-in regression functions.
- The dataset used is headbrain.csv, containing head sizes and brain weights of 237 individuals. This project is a comprehensive guide for beginners to understand and implement linear regression models from scratch 
  and using Python libraries.
